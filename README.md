# SafeHaven
"A ship is safe in the harbour... but that's not why a ship is made"

This repo contains dataset and script for analysis on Nifty 50 data.
Three portfolios have been constructed: (1) Index only portfolio (2) Fixed returns + Index fund portfolio (3) Insurance + Index fund portfolio
These portfolios were constructed at different allocations in case of mixed portfolios.
Median and fifth percentile returns were calculated in each case.
This analysis is inspired from "Safe Haven" by Mark Spitznagel
